# Migration

Hello everybody, I am dropping support for `python_version < 3.8.2` for the main branch.

Please use the `legacy` branch if you cannot use newer versions of `python`.

I am very sorry about this, but I am doing this in order to support more awesome features.

## Awesome Features

### User Experience

#### AAA

### Architectural

#### Isolated Process
